## Features

- REST API and GraphQL endpoints for movie data management.
- CSRF token generation and management.
- Swagger API documentation.
- Integration with TMDB API for fetching movie details.
- Dockerized environment setup for development and testing.
- Rate limiting with custom throttling guards.
- Response transformation with interceptors.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/remidosol/tmdb-nestjs.git
cd tmdb-nestjs
```

## Running the Application with Docker

Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and then run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will build the Docker image if it's not already built and start all services defined in `docker-compose.yml`, including the NestJS application and MongoDB.

## API Documentation

### Swagger

The Swagger documentation can be accessed at:

```bash
http://localhost:3333/api
```

### GraphQL Playground

The GraphQL Playground documentation can be accessed at:

```bash
http://localhost:3333/graphql
```

## Â Environment Variables

Ensure that you have a .env file located in `<rootDir>/secrets/.env`. This file should contain all the necessary environment variables required by the application.

Create a .env file in the secrets directory with the following variables:

```.env
DATABASE_URL=""

TMDB_API_KEY=""
TMDB_READ_ACCESS_TOKEN=""
```

## Testing

### Running Tests with Docker

To run the tests within the Docker environment, use the following Docker Compose command:

```bash
docker-compose run app yarn test
```

For end to end tests, use:

```bash
docker-compose run app yarn test:e2e
```

This command executes the tests inside the Docker container, ensuring that the testing environment is consistent with the development setup.

## Endpoints

### REST Endpoints

- **POST /csrf**: Generate CSRF token
- **GET /main_goal**: Fetch and persist top 5 movies from TMDB
- **GET /movie**: Get all movies with optional sorting
- **GET /movie/:movieId**: Get movie by ID
- **POST /movie**: Create a new movie
- **DELETE /movie/:movieId**: Delete a movie by ID

### GraphQL Queries

- **findById(id: String!): Movie**: Find a movie by ID

Example GraphQL query to execute in the playground:

```graphql
query GetMovieById($id: String!) {
  findById(id: $id) {
    id
    name
    overview
    releaseDate
    voteAverage
    voteCount
    genres {
      id
      name
    }
    popularity
  }
}
```

Example id:

```json
{
  "id": "12345"
}
```

Find more detailed documentation on each endpoint in the Swagger UI or the GraphQL Playground.

## Additional Information

- **MongoDB**: This application uses Mongoose to interact with MongoDB.
- **CSRF Protection**: Implemented using CSRF tokens.
- **Throttling**: Rate limiting is enforced using custom throttling guards.
- **Interceptors**: Used for transforming responses.
